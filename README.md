# Lab: 16 - Machine Learning Intro

## Tools Used

VS Code

Python

Poetry

Jupyter Lab

Pandas

sklearn

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

[x] Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.

[x] To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.

[x] A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.

[x] Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

## Implementation Notes

[x] You are only required to build the Baseline Model.

[x] Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.

[x] Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.

[x] Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them
